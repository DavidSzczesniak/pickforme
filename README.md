# PickForMe app

## General
Simple website I created with a randomizer as the foucs. It allows the user to input some items in their list and select a random item from said list, displaying it in a separate view. The aim of this project was to learn how to launch a full react project from scratch, and improve my general Web Design skills after a long hiatus from personal projects.

## Technologies
- React 16.13.1
- Create React App 3.4.1
